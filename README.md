# LogStructuredTree Clone

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is for me to learn through doing. I firmly believe that learning by doing is the best way to
fully comprehend a concept. This is my attempt to live by my own words. Yes, I commited the cardinal sin of not having tests.
This started as a learning exercise only. Tests will be added very soon.

```NOTE: This project should never be used in a production setting. It was not built with that goal in mind```
